# N-Queens Problem Solver

This is a Python app I built using Tkinter to help visualize and solve the N-Queens puzzle. You can place queens on the board, see valid moves, and even get help from an AI to solve it. The features are listed below:

- **Interactive board**: Place queens yourself and watch the board update in real-time.
- **Heuristic updates**: See how many queens are attacking each other after every move.
- **Valid moves**: It highlights where you can place queens safely.
- **AI solver:** Too tough? Let the AI solve it for you.
- **Undo button**: Go back a step if you want to try a different move.

**How It Works**

Start by entering the number of queens you want to solve for.
Click on the board to place queens, and the app will show you where you can place them safely.
Use the buttons to see valid moves, undo your last step, or let the AI handle it!
